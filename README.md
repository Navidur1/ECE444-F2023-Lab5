# Pros and Cons of TDD:

## Pros
The pros of using Test Driven Development is that it promotes good software design. Having to write tests before writing the rest of the code means that each developer needs to think critically about how the code should function and be structured. TDD can also isolate tests into small pieces, which means the final code will be more modular. Using TDD also means that the final product will be less buggy since there is a greater focus on testing throughout the whole process. Any major bugs will also be caught much earlier in the development process before they grow to become a really big pain to identify and fix.

## Cons
Test Driven Development also comes with some disadvantages, the main one being slowing down the development process. Gating developers to have to write tests before writing code makes it take longer to get to the final product. For very complex projects coming up with these tests first can also be a challenging task. Since there is such a big focus on testing there will be many more tests than normal, creating a very large and complex test suite. This might be much harder to maintain and understand, since we are writing tests for every possible scenario.
